# Hard Case for Vive Ultimate Trackers.



This design was made so you can have a place to keep your trackers away from danger, while travelling, charging or just for storage.  
There's a very secure conection when inserting your trackers with a satisfying click, they don't rattle or hit anything inside the case.  
It can fit 4 trackers and the dongle but unfortunately there's no space for your cable and the craddle due to print bed limitations. (I plan on making a new version for 5 trackers, the dongle, craddle and the cable which can fit in a common sized print bed 220x220.)   
   
# Printing.

* All parts are already in the correct printing orientation.
* It's very important that you use supports and as little as possible top Z spacing, so the hooks print correctly. If they don't print correctly or you couldn't remove all supports, you'll notice that the trackers won't click in place, or they don't hold well enough. If that's the case, you can try and sand the underside of these hooks.
* Use only PLA, or PETG. ABS will warp no matter what, even after it's done printing.   
* Print with 3 walls and at least 15% infill.
* If you're doing the logo version in multicolor, import both (Lid with Logo.stl) and (Logo for multicolor.stl) at the same time as a single object with multiple parts, otherwise the logo won't line up correctly.   
   
# Assembly
Assembly is very easy. Close the case and insert a piece of filament in all three hinges, if the holes on your print are too wide you can melt the ends of these filament bits so they don't fall off.
