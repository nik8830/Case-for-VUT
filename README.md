# Hard Case for Vive Ultimate Trackers.



This design was made so you can have a place to store and keep your trackers away from danger, while travelling, charging or just storing your trackers.  
There's a very secure conection when inserting your trackers with a satisfying click, so they don't wobble or rattle inside the case.  
It can fit 4 trackers and the dongle but unfortunately there's no space for your cable and the craddle due to print bed limitations. (I plan on making a new version for 5 trackers, the dongle, craddle and the cable which can fit in a most common sized print bed 220x220.)
